### Hi there 👋

I am a Partner and Senior Engineer at [Contiamo](https://contiamo.com) and core contributor to [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com).

⚒ I work with:
  - 💻 Go, Python, and, when I have to, Typescript 
  - 🔌 Kubernetes, Serverless, Observability, and other DevOps-ish things

🤝 Let's work together:

Need some help? I specialize in Go, Kubernetes, OpenFaaS, Observability (metrics and tracing), and distributed systems in general.
  - Doing something Open Source? DM me on [🐦Twitter](https://twitter.com/theaxer).
  - Have a production level challenge? Contact us at [📬 Contiamo](mailto:info@contiamo.com).
  

⚡ Fun facts:
  - 📜 I sometimes blog at [lucasroesler.com](https://lucasroesler.com/posts/)
  - 😻 I like 🧗rock climbing, 🍻 beer, 🥾 hiking, and my 🏍motorcycle.
  - 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
