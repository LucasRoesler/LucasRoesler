### Hi there 👋

I am a Partner and Senior Engineer at [Contiamo](https://contiamo.com) and core contributor to [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com).

⚒ I work with/on:
  - 💻 Go, Python, SQL, Bash, and (when I have to) Typescript 
  - 🧮 Data engineering with tools like [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs) and [DataHub](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub)
  - 🔌 Kubernetes, OpenFaaS, Observability, and other DevOps-ish things

🤝 Let's work together:

Need some help? I specialize in Go, Kubernetes, OpenFaaS, Observability (metrics and tracing), data engineering, and distributed systems in general.
  - Doing something Open Source? DM me on [🐦Twitter](https://twitter.com/theaxer).
  - Have a production level challenge? Contact us at [📬 Contiamo](mailto:info@contiamo.com).
